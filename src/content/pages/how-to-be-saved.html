                        <span class="cs-button-text">
                            Do I have to be baptized to be saved?
                        </span>
                        <span class="cs-indicator"></span>
                    </button>
                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        No, baptism is not required for salvation. Salvation comes by faith alone in Jesus Christ. Ephesians 2:8-9 clearly states, "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." Baptism is an act of obedience that follows salvation, but it is not part of salvation itself. The thief on the cross was saved by faith without being baptized (Luke 23:42-43).

                    <button class="cs-button">
                        <span class="cs-button-text">
                            Can I lose my salvation once I'm saved?
                        </span>
                        <span class="cs-indicator"></span>
                    </button>
                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        No, once you are truly saved, you cannot lose your salvation. Jesus said in John 10:28-29, "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." God's gift of eternal life is just that—eternal. Romans 8:38-39 assures us that nothing can separate us from God's love. True believers are secure in Christ because salvation is God's work, not ours.

                            What does it mean to repent?

                        <span class="cs-indicator"></span>
                    </button>
                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        Repentance means a change of mind about sin and about Christ. It's turning from your sin and turning to Jesus Christ as your Saviour. True repentance involves recognizing you are a sinner in need of a Saviour and believing that Jesus Christ died for your sins and rose again. It's not just feeling sorry for sin, but trusting Christ alone for salvation rather than trusting in your own good works or anything else.

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        You can know for certain because God's Word promises it. 1 John 5:13 says, "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life." If you have believed in Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour, trusting that He died for your sins and rose again, then you have eternal life. Your assurance is based on God's promise, not on your feelings or performance.

                        After receiving Christ as your Saviour, you should follow Him in believer's baptism by immersion, join a Bible-believing local church, read and study God's Word daily, pray regularly, and tell others about Jesus Christ.
