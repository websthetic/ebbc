                    <p class="cs-card-text">
                        We believe the Bible was written by holy men of God as they were supernaturally moved along by the Holy Spirit thus ensuring the inerrancy and completeness of the Holy Scriptures (2 Peter 1:21; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). It does not only contain and convey the Word of God, but is the very Word of God. It is the final revelation of the will of God to man (Revelation 22:18-19). God promised to preserve His Word throughout the ages(Psalm 12:6-7; 19:7-11; 119:89, 160; 138:2; Matthew 4:4; 24:35; 1 Peter 1:23-25).Inspiration - It is our belief that the original inspired texts were the Hebrew Masoretic Text (Old Testament) and the Greek Received Text (New Testament).Preservation - Since God has promised to preserve His Word, it is our belief that, for English speaking people, the King James Bible, the Authorized Version, because of its translation techniques and its underlying texts, is a Bible in which we can confidently place our faith as an accurate and authoritative translation of the original Scriptures. It is the only version we use.For those who might be unaware of the differences in Bible versions, read, as just one example, John 5:4 in the King James Bible and then try to find it in most other versions. It is usually totally removed or placed as a footnote questioning its authenticity.

                    <p class="cs-card-text">
                        We believe that in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. They are equal in every divine perfection and execute distinct but harmonious offices in the great work of redemption (Isaiah 48:16; Matthew 3:16-17; 1 John 5:7).

                    <p class="cs-card-text">
We believe that Jesus Christ was the eternal son of God; that without any change in His divine Person, He became man by miracle of the Virgin Birth. As man, He was tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin; that as the perfect Lamb of God He gave Himself in death upon the cross, becoming there the sin of the world, and suffering its full penalty of divine wrath in our stead. He arose bodily from the grave and was glorified. He sits now at the right hand of God as our High Priest, Advocate, and Intercessor (Isaiah 7:14; 53:6,10-12; John 10:30; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 4:14-15; 7:25; 1 John 2:1).                    </p>

                    <p class="cs-card-text">
                        We believe that the Holy Spirit is a divine person of equal nature with the Father and Son. He is the supernatural agent in regeneration and sanctification. He seals, indwells, guides, teaches, and prays with every believer. Webelieve the temporary sign gifts, including tongues and healings, ceased their confirming purpose with the completion of the New Testament (John 3:5-6; 14:16-17,26; 15:26; 16:8-11,13-14; Romans 8:9-11,14-16,26-27; 1 Cor.13:8-10; Ephesians 1:13-14; 4:30; 5:18).

                    <p class="cs-card-text">
                        We believe all men are sinners, by birth and choice, and are thus separated from a holy God. Salvation is a gift of God, available to any and all, brought by grace and received by personal faith in Jesus Christ. All who repent and believe are justified on the grounds of His shed blood. Salvation cannot be earned or merited and is apart from any works of man. All true believers are secure in their salvation. We reject all points of Calvinism as is commonly identified today in T.U.L.I.P. (Acts 2:37-38; 20:21; 26:20; Romans 3:10-19,23; 5:12,19; 6:11,23; 10:9-10,13; Ephesians 2:8-9; 1 Peter 1:3-5; 1 John 5:13).

                    <p class="cs-card-text">
                        We believe a local New Testament church is a congregation of baptized believers assembled for worship, fellowship, edification, and service. Its purpose rests in the great commission given by its Founder, Head and Builder, Jesus Christ. Truth is its foundation. It carries out two ordinances: believers baptism by immersion and observance of the Lords Supper. It has two offices: pastor and deacon (Matthew 16:18; Acts 2:41;1 Corinthians 11:23-34; Ephesians 5:23-32; 1 Timothy 3:15).

                    <p class="cs-card-text">
                        We believe Satan is a literal fallen angel who, as the enemy of God and man, tempts and accuses the believer as the god of this world. He will be judged and eternally punished in hell (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Isaiah 14:12-15; 1 Peter 5:8; Rev.12:7-10, 13:4; 19:20; 20:1-3,10).

                    <p class="cs-card-text">
                        We believe that God is holy and this standard is commanded of His children, His Word, and His church. We believe in a moral, personal, and ecclesiastical holiness. Thus, in order to fulfill this decree, the believer must separate himself personally from worldliness. To preserve the purity of the church and its doctrine, it becomes necessary to separate from organizations, fellowships, and associations that would teach or practice doctrinal error. We thus stand in opposition to the World Council of Churches, the Ecumenical Movement, the Charismatic Movement, New Evangelicalism, Interdenominationalism, and any cooperative evangelistic programs between people and churches not of like precious faith (Amos 3:3; Luke 12:51; Romans 16:17; 2 Corinthians 6:14-18; 7:1; Ephesians 5:11-12; Philippians 3:17-19; 2 Thessalonians 3:6-7,14-15; 1 Timothy 6:1-5; 1 Peter 1:14-16).s

We believe in a direct and instant creation that was completed in six literal, twenty-four-hour days. The Scriptures support a young earth created with the appearance of age. We reject any theory of evolution(Genesis 1:1-31; 2:21-23; John 1:3; Acts 4:24; 17:23-26; Romans 1:20; Colossians 1:16-17; Hebrews 11:3; Revelation 10:6).                    </p>

We believe in the imminent rapture of believers of this age followed by a literal seven year tribulation period upon the earth. This will be ended by Jesus Christs literal, personal, visible return to earth to set up His millennial kingdom (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 2 Thessalonians 1:6-12; Titus 2:13; Revelation 20:1-6,12-14).                    </p>
